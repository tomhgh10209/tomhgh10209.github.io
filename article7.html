            <p>With CNI acting as the backbone to the UK economy, enabling the movement of people, production of goods, providing essential service like power, water and food it is important to realise that without it, society as we know would slowly crumble.</p>
            <p>Not only this but it is also important to understand how CNI plays a role that is paramount to maintaining a balanced growth as well as creating sustainable employment opportunities for society. An example would be the current transition to net zero emissions which is predicted to generate over 1.2 million jobs, and this is just in the UK's low-carbon an renewable energy sectors by 2050.</p>
            <p>Recent years have interestingly seen a slowdown of investment and aging of technological systems, this is all whilst historical investment and commendable infrastructure quality has taken place. This problem has also been compounded by a lack of preparation for challenges such as population growth and climate change.</p>
            <p>Fortunately, the issue can be solved, however this will require government to create a thorough long-term vision for CNI, backed up by a five-year plan the outlines various sectors including but not limited to transportation, utilities and other general CNI. This is intended to streamline the CNI development process that is absolutely crucial when it come to providing the appropriate private sectors with the certainty that is required for investment in turn.</p>
            <p>Climate change has exposed the urgency for proper infrastructure that can adapt to evolving needs. Electrification, digitization, and enhanced climate resilience measures are what is required to reduce carbon emissions and mitigate the impacts of extreme weather events.</p>
            <p>Recent cutbacks and delays in major infrastructure projects, such as the scaling back of the Northern Powerhouse Rail and the cancellation of HS2 Phase 2, highlight the challenges facing the sector in securing necessary funding and navigating the planning process efficiently.</p>

            <h2>Recommendations for Mitigation</h2>
            <p><b>Long-Term Vision and Planning:</b> Advocate for the establishment of a dedicated governmental body tasked with developing and overseeing a long-term infrastructure vision and plan. Encourage cross-party consultation to ensure continuity and bipartisan support for infrastructure initiatives across different administrations.</p>
            <p><b>Streamlining Approval Processes:</b> Propose reforms to streamline the approval processes for infrastructure projects, such as implementing standardized procedures and reducing bureaucratic hurdles. Advocate for the use of digital technologies and online platforms to expedite the planning and approval process, while ensuring transparency and public participation.</p>
            <P><b>Policy Stability and Certainty:</b> Advocate for the establishment of clear and stable policy frameworks to provide certainty and predictability for infrastructure investors. Encourage the government to prioritize infrastructure as a strategic national priority and commit to sustained investment over the long term.</P>
