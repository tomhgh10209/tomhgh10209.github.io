        <h3>Introduction:</h3>
        <p>Welcome to this exclusive interview, here we will dive into the inticacies of the Royal Air Force's Cyber Security Flight (CSF) Training Delivery Squadron, to discuss its collaborative efforts when it comes to protecting and enhancing national security. Insights will be gained from suitably qualified and experienced personnel (SQEP) involed in the RAF's cyber operations, learning new information on the cruicality of public-private partnerships, innovative technologies and multi domain integration in safe guarding Great Britains front line ciritcal infrastructure. Join us as we reveal what role the RAF plays in shaping the future of britains cyber defence.</p>

            <div class="question">
                <p>Question 1: What are some of the key critical national infrastructure assets that the Royal Air Force is tasked with protecting?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>"Cannot answer, classified – sorry."</p>
            </div>
            <div class="question">
                <p>Question 2: How does the Royal Air Force collaborate with other branches of the military and government agencies to ensure the security of critical national infrastructure?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>"The RAF collaborates with a number of different agencies with regards to securing CNI, one being the National Cyber Force who are now operating under a new unified command structure which includes parties from MI6, the military and GCHQ. Alot of their work involves counter terorrism so this involves collaboration particularly from Cyber Command in the RAF."  </p>
            </div> 
            <div class="question">
                <p>Question 3: How do advancements in technology, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, impact the security of critical infrastructure?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>"Biggest impact, is in threat detection and automation of responses. ‘Real Time’ analysis is very difficult for humans, ML / AI can massively improve detection here. With the end goal being able to identify malicious activity quickly, enabling response quicker."</p>
            </div>
            <div class="question">
                <p>Question 4: What are the main cyber threats and challenges faced by the Royal Air Force in protecting critical infrastructure, and how are these threats evolving?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>"Cannot answer classified – sorry."</p>
            </div>
            <div class="question">
                <p>Question 5: Looking ahead, what do you see as the biggest challenges and priorities in securing critical national infrastructure in the future?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>"Not overly dissimilar from traditional networks; SQEP – The SQEP required to manage and maintain, takes time.</p>
                <p> Emerging Technologies. The mix of ‘old’ CNI technologies and the internet don’t mix well. The ideal would be to rip it all out and start again.

                 With the move to 5G / IoT / Driverless cars – what actually is CNI – do smart roads ready for driverless cars count? We have a heavily regulated airline industry, do we need to go that way with roads and people who code roads?
    
                    AIC. Most Inofsec starts with CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability), whereas most CNI needs AIC – availability is more important. Inherently, nothing wrong with this – however, people who accept those risks really need to understand the risk they are taking.</p>
                <p> Supply Chain / Manufactures. Most people are getting better in this, however, companies who traditionally made random electronic products are now being expected to produce cyber-secure products.

                    Culture. Discussions with Russian activities have played into this. Fixing some of these problems really needs a ‘national mindset’. Industry and Military working closer."</p>
            </div>
            <div class="question">
                <p>Question 6: What role does public-private partnership play in enhancing the security of critical national infrastructure, and how does the Royal Air Force engage with industry partners?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>"It plays a significant role, with the main focus of developing cutting edge technologies - it is typically defence contractors we partner with when it comes to enhancing security. Airbus being one of the partnerships to enhance information distribution and itelligence gathering to create advanced systems such as NEXUS Data Platform and RAVEN virtual Communications Node into RAF operations." </p>
