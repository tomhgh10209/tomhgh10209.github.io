            <p>Colin Ahern, a New York State cybersecurity expert discussed the problem of a growing danger to important national infrastructure from cyber threats. These include power grids and transport networks. Not only this but Ahern also explains that these threats are only increasing in severity and complexity especially due to state sanctioned cyber gangs becoming more and more common in the United States.</p>
            <p>The importance of working together as a team was stressed by Ahern between government and private companies in order to sucessfully deal with these threats made by attackers. Although the government runs the important systems, it is private owned companies that run the majority of them expressing the need for team work between the two parties.</p>
            <p>$1 billion was the sum given out across states with the intention of helping to build extra security measures to make these states more equipped to deal with this ever growing threat, spread out across the next four years.</p>
            <p>This year cyberattacks have already hit some cities hard. For example ransomeware became a big problem for Dallas, in Texas. This type of software encrypts victim data untill they pay the ransom that is set by the attacker, naturally causing lots of problems including part of the city's cour system being shut down.</p>
            <p>Ahern provided a clear message on the real threat cyber attacks pose, adn everyone must work together in order to combat this problem. Regardless of whether it is government, regular people or private companies, everyone has a role to play in staying vigilant to keep critical systems online and safe from attack.</p>

            <h2>Recommendations for Mitigation</h2>
            <p><b>Joint Cybersecurity Task Forces:</b> Establish joint cybersecurity task forces comprising representatives from government agencies, critical infrastructure providers, and cybersecurity experts. These task forces can coordinate incident response efforts, conduct threat assessments, and develop tailored cybersecurity solutions to address specific risks.</p>
            <p><b>Enhanced Information Sharing Platforms:</b> Implement secure information sharing platforms and protocols to facilitate timely exchange of threat intelligence and cyber incident data between government agencies and private sector organizations. This will enable proactive threat detection and response, reducing the impact of cyber attacks.</p>
            <P><b>Investment in Advanced Security Technologies:</b> Allocate resources for the procurement and deployment of advanced security technologies, such as intrusion detection systems, endpoint protection platforms, and threat intelligence platforms. These technologies can help detect and mitigate cyber threats more effectively, enhancing overall resilience.</P>
